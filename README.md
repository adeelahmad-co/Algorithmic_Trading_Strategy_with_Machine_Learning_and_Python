# Algorithmic_Trading_Strategy_with_Machine_Learning_and_Python
Developing an Algorithmic trading strategy with Python is something that goes through a couple of phases, just like when you build machine learning models: you formulate a strategy and specify it in a form that you can test on your computer, you do some preliminary testing or back testing, you optimize your strategy and lastly, you evaluate the performance and robustness of your strategy.  Trading strategies are usually verified by back testing: you reconstruct, with historical data, trades that would have occurred in the past using the rules that are defined with the strategy that you have developed.This way, you can get an idea of the effectiveness of your strategy, and you can use it as a starting point to optimize and improve your strategy before applying it to real markets.
